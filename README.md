<h3>Get to know a little bit about me</h3>
<p>- A multi-skilled Full-Stack developer with hands-on experience in developing. I graduated from Microverse, where people from all over the world join together to build different projects. I've spent the last several months completely immersed in remote development, pair-programmming, and building webpages with JavaScript, React/Redux, and Ruby/Rails.</p>
